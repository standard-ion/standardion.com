                <p class="lead">We are entering the Ion Age. The way we run our vehicles and supply predictable renewable power is
                    changing rapidly and significantly.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Iteration Zero
                        <p class="caption">"EVs" produce range anxiety, they are too unpredicatable and too expensive.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Iteration One
                        <p class="caption">EVs are advancing, but they come with a
                            high degree of waste. Expensive parts, replacing batteries and wasted time waiting to charge are the norm as owners sit
                            idle and fear long distance drives that will never come because of significant limitations.</p></li>
                    <li>Iteration Two
                        <p class="caption">Charging stations are coming online but not fast enough or in the right places to open up all of the driving landscape. 
                            Supercharging is available, but still slower than it takes to fill the gas/petrol tank of a ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) vehicle.
                            Drivers get slightly better utility and some time back when waiting to charge but it it nothing compared to filling up a gas tank.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <p class="copy">
                    <b>The third iteration</b> moves the focus to driving by improving the speed of charging to be
                    faster than an ICE vehicle can have it's gas tank filled.  Overall reducing cost and moving infrastructure 
                    elastically to where demand meets supply. We now virtualize charging into slices of
                    battery on demand, green generation, and a universal system that brings the cost of EV ownership far below 
                    that of prior EV iterations and ICE vehicles of every category. Our process produces far less
                    waste because the energy storage can be spun-up or down in reaction to demand nearly
                    instantly. We can scale charging to multiple nodes in places where capacity is available now,
                    whether in Boston or Hong Kong. To scale well, we have hardware and applications designed for the next age
                    of humanity, the Ion Age.  Self-contained units of power providing well-defined service on-demand to the whole 
                    of the modern distributed ecosystem that is predicatable renewables for consumer use, whether in EVs or spot power situations.

                <p class="copy">
                    The key element enabling this is dynamic capacity planning and elastic load alerting for the managed
                    clusters of battery banks. Do we need to scale now? If so, do we scale out because we need more resources to
                    serve an avalanche of demand? Or do we scale in, because SXSW has passed and our retail EV customers
                    no longer needs to use so many resources in the Austin area?

                    Our project is motivated to reduce waste by "right-sizing" energy consumption by linking it more
                    directly to demand. Not many have seen the inside of a large Data Center, but these are colossal
                    energy-hungry ventures[<a href="references.html">1</a>] on a scale that is difficult to appreciate
                    without seeing one in person.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Everything in a data center is planned around watt usage. Over half of the wattage goes to server
                    load and most of the rest to cooling equipment. If we can better predict and scale compute resource
                    load more efficiently we have the opportunity to effect change in the United States alone at about
                    the 9.1 TWhr (Terawatts per hour) level and, perhaps, slow the projected rise in consumption by 2020
                    to 13.9 TWhr [<a href="references.html">2</a>].

                    Our inferential goals are to understand how better to do capacity planning and alerting for
                    renewable-based, managed clusters of battery resources. We learned what
                    makes a good alert threshold, such that we can predictably recommend actions that will keep renewble power
                    highly available under various demand scenarios ranging from low to high. Effectively,
                    we want to investigate the elasticity of supply and demand on renewable generated power resources so that we can make
                    ongoing dynamic recommendations about the proper scale for a given set of inputs.

                    that allows many
                    applications to scale easily in and out.
                    <br><br>
                    This data provided us insight into the nature of a completely container-based approach.

                    We started by analyzing a general container metric which gave around 3,000 instances (containers)
                    running on
                    this particular Cloud Foundry foundation. We found that the mean instance CPU utilization was very

                    Each instance consumed the about 500 Mb or memory.

                    Our goal was to identify how we could concentrate workloads to reduce energy consumption, so we
                    began looking for application data we could use to identify patterns.
                    <br>
                    We were able to get a number
                    of applications running on Pivotal Web Services. We added application performance monitoring by
                    binding all our microservices to a free trial of <a href="https://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>. The
                    New Relic suite is superb at
                    tracking web and service transaction metrics such as response time and throughput. However, after
                    initial exploration, we found it very difficult to export the data in a way that we could identify
                    individual application utilization.

                    Next we have a free subscription to <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com">DataDog</a>. We found the
                    metrics were too high level for what we
                    needed. They tended to be at the host/server level.

                    Since each application runs in it’s own container, we thought we could get equivalent data from a
                    container solution. Coincidentally, we were given a demo of an internal Pivotal APM tool.

                    was using.<br>

                    Just to get a sense of general performance across the different services, we plotted the three different
                    readings: memory usage, disk usage, and CPU utilization. For easy readibility,
                    we have removed the exact timestamps from our x-axis. Below is an example lot of disk usage for PaaS:

                    We took a look at our container data again, this time grouped by application, IP address, and Instance Index.
                    Cloud Foundry assigns each application a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) that we can use to identify a single application.
                    Below is a sample plot of memory consumption, grouped by application.

                    We then analyzed some of the relationships between memory/disk usage and CPU utilization in more detail on
                    an app by app basis. For further analysis, we should be concerned with instances and applications that appear in the top right or bottom left corners of these plots
                    - areas where both CPU Utilization and Memory/Disk Usage are considered to be high or low.
                    When a process is in this area, we can begin to consider scaling out compute resources. Likewise, if we are residing in an area
                    with low usage for both, we can start to ratchet down compute resources to scale them in.

                Our data allowed us to group high and low utilization applications.
                We will be able to segregate the high usage services, with common patterns, through anti-affinity rules while letting the others fill in the gaps.
                Moreover, these pattern identification methods allow us to predict scaling needs before thresholds are met.
                This will allow us to scale out, along with scaling in as demand fades.
                The capability to reduce capacity will cut down on future electricity consumption.
